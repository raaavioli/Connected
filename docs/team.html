            <h1>The Team</h1>
            <p>Hello!</br>
            We're the team responsible for this project, consisting of six Computer Science/Interactive Media Technology students partaking in the Advance Graphics and Interaction (AGI) course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.</br>
            This project has been quite large and ambitious, so naturally we had to divide the workload amongst ourselves, to make it work within the given time frame. We've mostly played to our initial skills and interests, but also explored new areas of development, resulting in both deepening and broadening learning experiences for all of us.</br>
            We chose to make an interactive VR simulator, because we felt that doing activities that are normally quite unavailable to people in the physical world available in the virtual world was a good and valueable experience. With the focus of reaching children as target groups, we thought that circuitry learning is something that is very expensive for schools to provide and comes with a fair risk of harm, so why not remove those obstacles by having unlimited resources and no hazard to childrens' well-being in the virtual world? </br>
            We hope you find our project interesting, regardless if you possess a VR device to try it out yourself. Note that making a complete experience was never the intention, due to limited time, but rather to make a proof of concept.</br>
            Don't hesitate to reach out to us, if you have questions this website weren't able to answer.</p>

                <p>For this project I got to focus on the logic behind the circuits. This included making sure the math is correct and that connections were functioning as expected. I also contributed to scripts adjacent to my work and mostly kept myself working within gameplay programming.</p>
