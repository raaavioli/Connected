# Connected
Second shorter project for the Advanced Graphics and Interaction (AGI21) course. We create a VR experience for learning about and playing with electrical circuits. The idea is simple, you spawn the components you need, and you connect them! The inspiration came from a mixture of ideas. First of all, when we were younger in elementary school ages we all played with electricity at some point, but schools had limited resources and tools, which limits the extent that electricity can be explored. To address this, we wanted to create an environment where you have endless possibilities without consequences. We wanted to let people explore the limits electricity without any fear of breaking things or risk injury. 

## Application / Gameplay
Connected is a safe sandbox environment to play with electrical components such as batteries, lamps, wires, sound devices and switches in parallel and series circuits. Exploring what works and what does not is part of the experience. You spawn in a small room with a set of tools and components that can be spawned. A player spawns wires using the VR controllers, and connects them to positive and negative connectors of any spawned components.

## Limitations
Due to limited time of the project, the environment is limited and so is the number of functional components. The idea was to allow the player to be able to have visual feedback of how much current goes through the circuit, what resistance different components have, and how much voltage a battery provides. The foundation of the application is built around electricity taking voltage, current, resistance and power into account, however there is no way for the player to know any of this underlying information at the moment.

The number of functional connectable components is also limited to lamps, radios and batteries, which are connected through wires.
